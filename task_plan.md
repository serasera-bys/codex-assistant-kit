## Goal
Turn Codex into my consistent assistant: planning-first, GO-gated execution, and file-based memory.

## Constraints
- No new tools unless requested
- Plans must be <=6 steps
- Always include verification commands + expected outputs

## Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Install assistant rules (AGENTS.md + skills)
- [ ] Phase 2: Dry-run workflow (plan-first + capture-idea)
- [ ] Phase 3: Apply to a real repo (later: ROS2 capstone)

## Definition of Done
- Skills are discoverable in Codex
- Codex consistently asks 1 goal question, then produces plan, then waits for GO
- Ideas can be captured to inbox.md reliably
